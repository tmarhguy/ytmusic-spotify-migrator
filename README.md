## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tmarhguy/ytmusic-spotify-migrator.git
cd ytmusic-spotify-migrator

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### Setup

1. **Get Spotify API credentials** from [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root:
   ```bash
   # Your Spotify API credentials
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/callback
   ```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Test with sample data (dry run)
yt2spot migrate --input sample_likes.txt --dry-run --verbose

# Run actual migration to like songs on Spotify
yt2spot migrate --input sample_likes.txt --verbose

# Interactive mode for manual decisions
yt2spot migrate --input your_music.csv --interactive

# Limit number of songs for testing
yt2spot migrate --input your_music.csv --limit 10
```

## 📈 What It Does

YT2Spot automatically:

1. **📁 Parses** your music files (CSV, JSON, or TXT format)
2. **🔍 Searches** Spotify for each song using intelligent queries
3. **🎯 Matches** tracks using fuzzy algorithms (title, artist, album)
4. **❤️ Likes** found tracks on your Spotify account
5. **📊 Reports** success rate and detailed results

**Real example output:**

```
📁 Parsing input file: sample_likes.txt
✓ Parsed 5 songs from TXT file
🔐 Authenticating with Spotify...
✓ Authenticated as Your Name
🎵 Processing 5 songs...
✓ Liked: Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen
✓ Liked: Hotel California by Eagles
✓ Liked: Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin

📊 Migration Summary:
  Total songs processed: 5
  Successfully matched: 4
  Songs liked on Spotify: 4
  Success rate: 80.0%
```

## 📥 Input File Formats

YT2Spot supports multiple input formats:

### 📄 **TXT Format** (Simple)

```txt
Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen
Hotel California - Eagles
Stairway to Heaven - Led Zeppelin
```

### 📊 **CSV Format** (Detailed)

```csv
Title,Artist,Album,Duration
"Bohemian Rhapsody","Queen","A Night at the Opera","5:55"
"Hotel California","Eagles","Hotel California","6:30"
```

### 🗂️ **JSON Format** (Structured)

```json
{
  "tracks": [
    {
      "title": "Bohemian Rhapsody",
      "artist": "Queen",
      "album": "A Night at the Opera",
      "duration": "5:55"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 📥 Getting Your YouTube Music Data

### Option 1: Using Google Takeout (Recommended)

1. Go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com)
2. Select "YouTube and YouTube Music"
3. Choose "music-library-songs" → "liked songs"
4. Download and extract the archive
5. Use the exported file directly with YT2Spot

### Option 2: Manual Export with Preprocessing

If you have raw YouTube Music playlist data, use our preprocessing tool:

1. Place your raw data in `tools/text-to-csv/music-taste.txt`
2. Run the preprocessor:
   ```bash
   cd tools/text-to-csv
   python cleaner.py
   ```
3. Use the generated `output.csv` with YT2Spot

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Key Settings

| Setting            | Default | Description                          |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `hard_threshold`   | 0.87    | Auto-accept matches above this score |
| `reject_threshold` | 0.60    | Auto-reject matches below this score |
| `max_candidates`   | 5       | Max search results per song          |

### CLI Options

```bash
# Matching thresholds
yt2spot migrate --input songs.csv --hard-threshold 0.9 --reject-threshold 0.5

# Processing limits
yt2spot migrate --input songs.csv --limit 50 --verbose

# Interaction modes
yt2spot migrate --input songs.csv --interactive  # Manual decisions
yt2spot migrate --input songs.csv --dry-run      # Test without changes
```

## 🧠 How It Works

YT2Spot uses sophisticated matching algorithms:

1. **🔍 Multi-strategy Search**: Uses multiple Spotify search queries per song
2. **🎯 Fuzzy Matching**: Compares titles, artists, and albums using rapidfuzz
3. **⚖️ Weighted Scoring**: Title (50%), Artist (35%), Album (10%), Popularity (5%)
4. **🤖 Smart Decisions**: Auto-accept high scores, auto-reject low scores
5. **❤️ Track Liking**: Automatically likes matched songs on your Spotify account

### Matching Process

- **Text Normalization**: Removes "(Official Video)", extracts featured artists
- **Search Strategies**: Exact matches, partial matches, broad searches
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Multiple fuzzy matching techniques combined
- **Threshold-based Decisions**: Configurable acceptance/rejection thresholds

## 🚀 Current Status & Roadmap

### ✅ **Sprint 1 Complete - Production Ready!**

- ✅ End-to-end migration pipeline working
- ✅ 80% success rate on real music data
- ✅ Spotify OAuth2 integration
- ✅ Multi-format input support
- ✅ Interactive and automatic modes
- ✅ Rich progress tracking and error handling

### 🗺️ **Planned Features (Sprint 2+)**

- 📝 **Playlist Creation**: Create actual Spotify playlists (not just liked songs)
- 🔄 **Undo Functionality**: Unlike songs, reverse migrations
- 📊 **Enhanced Reporting**: Export detailed migration reports
- 🌐 **Web Interface**: Drag-and-drop web UI
- ⏯️ **Resume Migrations**: Continue interrupted transfers
- 📅 **Release Date Matching**: Better disambiguation using years

```

## 🎯 Matching Algorithm

YT2Spot uses a sophisticated matching algorithm that considers:

1. **Title Similarity**: Normalized Levenshtein distance and token matching
2. **Artist Matching**: Primary and featured artist comparison
3. **Popularity Boost**: Slight preference for popular tracks (when similarity is high)
4. **Version Detection**: Penalties for live/remix/remaster mismatches
5. **Feature Extraction**: Smart parsing of "feat.", "ft.", and "featuring"

### Text Normalization

- Removes YouTube qualifiers: "(Official Video)", "[Official Audio]", etc.
- Extracts featured artists: "Song (feat. Artist)" → "Song" + ["Artist"]
- Handles "The" prefix: "The Beatles" → "Beatles, The"
- Casefold and punctuation normalization

### Decision Thresholds

- **≥ Hard Threshold**: Automatic acceptance
- **< Reject Threshold**: Automatic rejection → logged as unmatched
- **Between Thresholds**:
  - Interactive mode: User prompt
  - Fuzzy mode: Accept if above fuzzy threshold
  - Default: Log as unmatched
